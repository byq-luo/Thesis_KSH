## Abstract
License plate detection serves as one of the most widely-used real world application in the fields like toll control,
traffic scene analysis, and suspected vehicle tracking. Along with license plate information, to obtain overall
comprehension, the information of the owner vehicle also plays a great role. We proposed a one-stage anchor-free
object detector for detecting license plates and vehicles' poses and their regions. The detector, other than bounding
boxes, gives bounding quadrilaterals which gives a more precise indication for license plates. For single scale input,
We reached license plate mAP/mAP50 of 35.4/82.3 on the benchmark dataset, already outperformed the existing commercial
systems OpenALPR and Sighthound. For multi-scale input, we reached the best mAP/mAP50 of 40.8/90.1. For the
classification for the car pose (front or rear), we reached 98.8% accuracy, giving a promising result as a end-to-end
license plate detector with contextual information.
