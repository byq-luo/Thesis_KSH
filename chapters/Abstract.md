# Abstract
License plate detection serves as one of the most widely-used real-world applications in fields like toll control, traffic scene analysis, and suspected vehicle tracking. Along with license plate information, to obtain overall comprehension, the pose information of the owner vehicle also plays a great role. Thus we proposed a one-stage anchor-free object detector for simultaneously detecting the region of license plates and vehicles' poses. The detector, rather than bounding boxes, gives bounding quadrilaterals, which gives a more precise indication for license plates. For single scale input, we reached license plate mAP/mAP50 of 35.4/82.3 on the benchmark dataset, already outperformed the existing commercial systems OpenALPR and Sighthound. For multi-scale input, we reached the best mAP/mAP50 of 40.8/90.1. For the car pose (front-rear), classification accuracy reached 98.8%, average IoU reached 71.3%, giving a promising result as an end-to-end license plate detector with contextual information.
